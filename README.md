# NLP-Netflix-Project
Netflix Python Project Utilizing NLP and Neural Networks

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a sample size of 50,000 (25,000 for both positive and negative reviews) from all 108,116 reviews and applied the sample size into a Neural Network.

Results: While both the positive and negative samples had similar terminology found in both, the negative reviews seemed to be all related to technical issues such as the account, updates, phone, and the app being the biggest issues. The sample was then inputted into a Neural Network, where it was able to receive an accuracy score of 83%; the results indicate the model was effective in assessing whether a rating from a Netflix user is either positive or negative.

For additional information regarding the analysis, please refer to the Python file, thank you.
